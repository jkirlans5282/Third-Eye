# Third-Eye
Iphone app which pulls the nearest webcam from evercam and displays it on the screen,
I might eventually get around to making it show all webcams within a user specified distance. 
Whats interesting is that most cameras don't have RTMP streams, so the way this works is by requesting a new jpg everytime the phone pings for its current GPS location. There also does not seem to be enough publically available ip cams to make it useful.
